		<h2>History column</h2>
		During the first world war Portslade was host to many regiments. Camps were set up in Portslade for many local regiments before they went over the border.
<br /><br />
Private C.E. Bish 32899, 3rd Norfolk Regiment, was one of many to be stationed at the Army School of Cooking at Portslade Camp. While here he wrote a diary, which has been used to find out more about military life in Portslade. There are quite a few photos of Bish, in comparison to most soldiers of his rank.
<br /><br />
By 1918, 14,000 British army cooks had qualified in the Army School of Cooking at Portslade Camp. Portslade had quite a part in the war effort.
<br /><br />
The location of the camp was found where currently the Locks crescent housing estate. The camp stayed in action till 1924, training British army cooks.

		<h2>Portslade's notable residents column</h2>
<br />
John Herbert Edwin Shepherd (29 May 1932 – 11 June 2018) was an English professional association football player. He played for Millwall, Brighton & Hove Albion and Gillingham between 1952 and 1961.
<br /><br />
John grew up in second world war Kensington in a working class family on Southam street. One of 10 children growing up in poverty.
<br /><br />
John shepherd did his national service in the RAF, which took him away from football, although Millwall continued to keep in contact.
<br /><br />
John married Esther Gonzalez (a Spanish civil war Refugee), and had four children. After the birth of their first child they moved down to Brighton, and John signed for Brighton and Hove Albion football club. John moved to Portslade, Applesham way. It is said there was great excitement in Portslade when John moved there.
<br /><br />
After John's great football career, still holding many records today, he became a manager at Southwick Footbal club.
<br /><br />
Many of John's children and grandchildren still live in Portslade today.
<br /><br />
A book written by his daughter "In and out the Lions den" is available on Amazon. A biography on the war, poverty and football in John's life.
<br /><br />
Today there is a match in his memory at Southwick, to raise money for Parkinsons disease. Please come along and get a ticket for £2 to watch Brighton and Hove Albion legends play Southwick football club.

      <h1 class="">Portslade docks</h1><!-- Title-->
		<h2>History column</h2>
<br />
Being close to the coast, it is thought the area was used as a port by the Romans. A Roman road is found behind Emmaus, beneath the current road. The Romans possibly used the area to transport troops and supplies. 
<br /><br />
Later on in 1750s after Clive's success in India, Wolfe's capture of Quebec, and many other victories in the early days of the British empire, private individuals invested more and more in international trade. Ports in the south regions of Britain were built, and Portslade was no exception. 
<br /><br />
The 21 Gentleman were commisoners of Shoreham harbour. The group was made up of a series of merchants, shipbuilders and local landowners, with a occasional titled member. 
<br /><br />
In around 1760 the mouth of the river Adur had arrived, and it is believed this is when the port came into action. By the 1800s the Portslade docks were in full operation, and was receiving interest from sailors and Lords.
<br /><br />
The Portslade area of the docks currently enjoys lots of trade vessels exporing and importing supplies, proudly flying their Red Ensign flags of the Merchant Navy.

      <h1 class="">Station road</h1><!-- Title-->
		<h2>History column</h2>
<br />
Until the 19th century, station road (boundary road on the other side) was nothing but farmland.
<br /><br />
Under the reign of Queen Victoria, many railways were built as the newest and fastest method of travel. In 1840 the rail arrived in Portslade, with a stylish Victorian station.
<br /><br />
In the South end of the road, some fine villas were built. Big homes, overlooking the sea. Most of the villas were built in the 1860s, which meant drainage systems were not very advanced. When later digs were conducted in the area, deep caverns were found, thought to formerly be the cess-pits.
<br /><br />
The nabourhood had fairly wealthy residents such as surgeons, doctors and members of the church. It's thought that John Blaker, a relation to Edward Blaker who formerly owned Easthill house, also lived there.
<br /><br />
In 1903 Hove Council decided to rename their side of the street Boundary road. This was before Portslade Council merged with Brighton and Hove, as we see today.
<br /><br />
It's recorded that in 1911 a chap by the name George Alfred would ride on his bycicle and light all the lamps in the area. Up until 1935, Station road was lit by gas, but this year Portslade council finally decided to change to electric.
<br /><br />
It's hard to believe that Station road, such a busy and commercial street, was once a peaceful location for villas.<br />

Portslade once had a bridge, connecting both sides of the High Street. It became the landmark of Portslade, being featured on postcards. In 1885 a steam roller didn't quite calculate the gradient of the road, while carrying logs. The incident resulted in the steam funnel firing out sparks, setting fire to the bridge.
<br /><br />
There have been many steam roller incidents on the hill, including one where a steam roller overturned (1914 8th April).

			<div class="w3-row w3-padding-64">
A replacement bridge was built, and in 1904 we see an image of it connecting two portions of the land belonging to Author George Halls, owner of the Portslade estate at that time.
<br /><br />
In 1920 it is recorded that St Nicholas infant school, now a primary school, went on school trips to the bridge. The highlight was standing on the bridge and watching vehicles go underneath.
<br /><br />
The upkeep of the bridge remained a private concern up until 1935, when the Portslade estate was broken up. Portslade council (now a part of Brighton and Hove Council) was going to take over ownership, but it became too much of a liability, so were advised against it. The bridge was offered to East Sussex County Council, who also declined. In 1937 permission was given for the bridge to be demolished.
<br /><br />
Residents say that the bridge remained there through the second world war, and was not demolished until 1946. Traces of where the bridge connected with the wall are still visible today (near the entrance of King’s School)

The manor lodge was built in 1785. There has been many owners of the manor lodge, such as John Borrer (who was Lord of Portslade). It could be rented for 4000 herrings. It sits in front of some grounds currently holding several horses. This land is now owned by the church and rented to the local stables.
 <br /> <br />
The house formerly employed servants, including a footman and a lady’s maid. A lady's maid was expected to keep an inventory of all her mistress's clothes and ensure they were clean and mended.
 <br /> <br />
Footmen were expected to polish silver, clean boots and answer the door. All the servants would be under a butler who kept control of the house. The small lodge must have been quite busy and active.
 <br /> <br />
Some residents remember toffee apples being sold from the front doorstep. It is now divided into four flats.

The above pictures were taken 4 months apart. The first picture is the most up to date. As you can see a tree, lots of weeds and damaging ivy has grown since before.
<br /><br />
Local groups have been showing an interest in the taking over and upkeep of the manor house. You would think a project saving the council work and money, and caring for the historic monument would be in everyone's best interest. The council officers involved have been slow to reply and uninterested in the project proposed by local portslade residents.
<br /><br />
If council officers had to be elected, would some of them still ignore the people they are responsible to? As you may know ivy is damaging to brickwork, roots are damaging to foundations and plants block view. It would be a shame if Portslade lost the oldest non-church monument in the entire city, to destructive and avoidable plants.
<br /><br />
Local councillors for South Portslade have shown support for the project and are helping to get the Council officers to respond. Hopefully we will be seeing it maintained and open to public viewing all week round.

	  <h1 class="">Hannah Brakenbury</h1><!-- Title-->
		<h2>Notable residents column</h2>

<br />This week's notable resident is Hannah Brakenbury. A wealthier member of Portslade who donated lots of money to the schools and church. She also donated 15,000 pound to Oxford, Balloil college.
<br />
<br />Portslade infant school has recently renamed itself "Brakenbury primary school", after Hannah Brakenbury's genourous donations of a building for the school. This building is currently known as the Annex.
<br />
<br />Donations over the years to the church resulted in the building of the Brackenbury chapel. This is where Hannah Brackenbury is currently buried. Sadly, it is being used as storage for the church, with a ladder and several boxes. Rather disgraceful.

      The walled garden in Easthill Park (entrance located next to the car park) has always been a secret compartment to the park. The garden is currently home to many trees, shrubs and flowers.<br />
<br />
Easthill Park's house was built by Edward Blaker, although parts of it are believed to be built onto an existing building dating back to the 17th century.<br />
<br />
The walled garden was formally called the kitchen garden, and grew a number of herbs and vegetables. The wall was built using a horizontal line of pebbles. The wall is under a constant state of repairs, due to people climbing over and damaging it.<br />
<br />
The garden has started to fall into disrepair, where the ground is dry and weeds growing everywhere. A local gardening project started at the beginning of summer, who are always looking for more volunteers.<br />
<br />
We have seen several ferns planted, and soil taken care of. Herbs were planted, but some members of the community decided to steal the signs and walk over the plants. Come next season the project workers hope to start the herbs off inside, and plant them out when they are ready.<br />

	  <h1 class="">The stables of Portslade</h1><!-- Title-->
		<h2>History column</h2>
      Portslade has been, and still is home to many stables. Horses were once the main method of travel around England, therefore Portslade had many.
.
The original stables would have belonged to Kemps, which was built in 1540. The building materials used within many of Portslade's standing stables make us estimate they date back to the Georgian era. Stables were greatly improved by the Victorians, with official guidelines to keep them clean.
<br />
In 1980 the site of the stables were sold and houses built. A sign remains there today, as seen in the first image below. The second image is someone actually using the stables in the 1960's.
<br /><br /><img src="assets/stableVil.png" alt="stable" class="center" width="300" height="200"><img src="assets/stableride.png" alt="Trulli" class="center" width="300" height="200"><br /><br />
Mileoak farm currently has their own stables, as does the old manor lodge near the village centre.
<br />
There remains a disused area of Easthill Park, originally being the stables of Edward Blaker (the first owner of Easthill house). The stable area still remains, however it is overgrown, damp and used for storage. There is belief the council is going to build housing along that area, but nothing has been made official.
<br /><br /><img src="assets/stablepark.png" alt="Trulli" class="center" width="300" height="200"><br /><br />
The building where Emmaus is, as mentioned before is an old manor house. Naturally the Lord of the manor had a stables, which currently is an outbuildings the the charity. The old doors have been painted green, as seen below.
<br /><br /><img src="assets/stableman.png" alt="Trulli" class="center" width="300" height="200"><br /><br />
The old coach house was never really viewable to the community, until now. It has been turned into loverly little apartments, keeping with the traditional architecture of Portslade.

These buildings all remain here today. The brewery is currently undergoing renovations to become flats, while keeping the traditional outside look.<br />
<br />
Farming and brewing was the main source of income for Portslade, and being so close to the sea, easy to ship across all of the former British Empire. Now many people commute to Brighton and Hove (or further) for their jobs.<br />
<br />
Portslade continues with its by sea export and farming. Mileoak farm continues as a working farm, with a nice cafe, farm shop and many animals to see.<br />

		<h2>Notable residents column</h2>
      <p>Every sunday we will be posting a column on notable Portslade residents, both past and present.
		<br />
		Today's notable resident is Samual Isger, Royal navy. As it is Merchant Navy day tomorrow, it's more than fitting to do a maritime figure.
		<br />
		Isger was a Naval veteran, having joined the Royal Navy in 1852. Records state that he was of small stature, being only 5-ft and 1in. tall, with a fair complexion and grey eyes.
		<br />
		He served on board many ships and every commander he served under described his conduct as being "very good". It may not sound it, but in military terms that is very high.
		<br />
		The ships he served on were:
		<br />•HMS London (1853-1856)
		<br />•HMS Batterer(1856)
		<br />•HMS Raleigh(1856)
		<br />•HMS Alligator(1857)
		<br />•HMS Nanking 1857-1859)
		<br />•HMS Victory (1859)
		<br />•HMS Hannibal (1859)
		<br />
		Being after the battle of Trafalgar (1805), to serve on board HMS Victory was considered a great honour.

		<h2>History column</h2>
      <p>The old Portslade Manor ruins is one of the oldest monuments in Portslade. A historically protected building, with national importance
		  <br />
          After the Lord of the manor moved to a new manor house, currently the Emmaus building, 
		  the building was used as a poor house. Local theory is that the Lord of the manor did not 
		  like the impoverished living so close to his home, thus had it destroyed. The bricks were used to make a folly, 
		  currently next to the Emmaus building. Back in the Victorian Era, it became popular to have a folly on your land<br />
		
		  The ruins are currently overgrown, and under the jurisdiction of Brighton and Hove council. A local group of volunteers 
		  has been looking into the restoration of the Manor house, and have it viewable by the public. It will be an add on the 
		  the Portslade History Trail made by the charity Fresh Start Portslade.
